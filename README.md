# WoW game bot

Used for disenchanting a lot of items without manually pressing the macro key.

```
Example: 

Given that you have the following disenchanting macro in game: 

/cast disenchant
/use item:54473

bound to F2 key. Then run the PresKey.exe like this: 

> PressKey.exe 100

where "100" is the number of items you need to disenchant. 
```
