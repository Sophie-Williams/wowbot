# WoW game bot

Used for disenchanting a lot of items without manually pressing the macro key.

```
Example: 

Given that you have the following disenchanting macro in game: 

/cast disenchant
/use item:54473

bound to F1 key. Then run the PresKey.exe like this: 

> PressKey.exe F1 100

where "F1" is the function key to which the macro is bound and "100" is the number of items you need to disenchant. 

If you run it without any command line arguements, then the default key is F1 and the default number of items is 100.

Note: Use only keys from F1 to F12!
